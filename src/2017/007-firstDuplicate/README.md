# firstDuplicate

Interview question of the [issue #007 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/of-all-sad-words-of-tongue-or-pen-the-saddest-are/).

# The question

**Write a function that takes in a string and returns the first duplicate character it finds.**

Bonus points: write another function that takes in a string and removes all the duplicate characters.

# Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
