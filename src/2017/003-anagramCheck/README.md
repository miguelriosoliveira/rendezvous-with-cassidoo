# anagramCheck

Interview question of the [issue #003 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/sometimes-im-so-sweet-even-i-cant-stand-it-julie/).

# The question

**Write a function that takes in two strings and returns true if they are anagrams.**

# Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
