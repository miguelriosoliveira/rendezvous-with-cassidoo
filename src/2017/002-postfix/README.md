# postfix

Interview question of the [issue #002 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/you-can-tell-how-smart-people-are-by-what-they/).

# The question

**Write a simple postfix calculator function that takes in a string expression and returns the result.**

Example usage:
```js
postfix('5 4 * 6 2 / +')
> 23
```

[Here's a hint](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs2121/fix.html) if you don't know what postfix is!

# Installing & Running

Just `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn test` to run the tests!
