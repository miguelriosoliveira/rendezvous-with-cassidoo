# rotateArray

Interview question of the [issue #008 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/what-matters-most-is-how-well-you-walk-through/).

# The question

**Implement a function `rotateArray(int[] arr, n)` which rotates an array by `n` places.**

Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] rotated by 2 gives [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

# Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
