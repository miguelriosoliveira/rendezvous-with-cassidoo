# sortStacks

Interview question of the [issue #006 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/it-is-better-to-light-a-candle-than-curse-the/).

# The question

**Write 2 functions that sort a stack (one function with the smallest items on top, the other with the largest items on top).**

Try to do this one using only stacks, no other things like arrays, lists, or queues. You have access to the functions pop, peek, push, and isEmpty.

# Installing & Running

Just `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn test` to run the tests!
