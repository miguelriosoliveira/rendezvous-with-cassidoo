# printTree

Interview question of the [issue #271 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/everybody-gets-so-much-information-all-day-long/).

## The Question

**Given an integer n, print a balanced binary tree with n leaf nodes using the characters `/`, `<space>` and `\`.**

Examples:

```js
> printTree(2)

/\

// or you could output something like:

 /\
/  \

> printTree(3)

 /\
/\ \

// or you could output something like:

  /\
 / /\
/ /  \
```

## Installing & Running

Just `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn test` to run the tests!
