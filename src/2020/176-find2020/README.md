# find2020

Interview question of the [issue #176 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/we-are-what-we-repeatedly-do-excellence-then-is/).

## The Question

You’re given a string of characters that are only 2s and 0s. Return the index of the first occurrence of “2020” without using the indexOf (or similar) function, and -1 if it’s not found in the string.

Example:
```js
$ find2020('2220000202220020200')
$ 14
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
