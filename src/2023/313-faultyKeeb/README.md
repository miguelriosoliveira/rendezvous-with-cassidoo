# faultyKeeb

Interview question of the [issue #313 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/the-road-to-success-is-always-under-construction/).

## The Question

**You have a faulty keyboard. Whenever you type a vowel on it (`a`,`e`,`i`,`o`,`u`,`y`), it reverses the string that you have written, instead of typing the character. Typing other characters works as expected. Given a string, return what will be on the screen after typing with your faulty keyboard.**

Example:

```js
> faultyKeeb('string')
> 'rtsng'

> faultyKeeb('hello world!')
> 'w hllrld!'
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
