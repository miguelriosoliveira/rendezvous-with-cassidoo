# justifyText

Interview question of the [issue #308 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/2447/).

## The Question

**Given an array of strings and a max width, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully justified.** You can choose how you want to wrap a word.

Example:

```js
> justifyText(["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], 16)
> [
    "This    is    an",
    "example  of text",
    "justification.  "
  ]
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
