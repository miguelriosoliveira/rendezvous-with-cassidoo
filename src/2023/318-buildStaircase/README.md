# buildStaircase

Interview question of the [issue #318 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/let-us-remember-that-our-voice-is-a-precious-gift/).

## The Question

**You have `n` equal-sized blocks and you want to build a staircase with them. Return the number of steps you can fully build.**

Example:

```js
> buildStaircase(6)
> 3

// #
// ##
// ###

> buildStaircase(9)
> 3 // it takes 10 blocks to make 4 steps
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
