Interview question of the [issue #313 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/the-road-to-success-is-always-under-construction/).

## The Question

**Make a "guessing game" where there is a target number, and as the user makes guesses, the output returns `higher` or `lower` until the user is correct.**

Example usage:

```sh
Guess the number!
> 10
higher
> 20
higher
> 30
lower
> 25
higher
> 27
Correct! You won in 5 guesses!
```

## Installing & Running

Just `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn test` to run the tests!
