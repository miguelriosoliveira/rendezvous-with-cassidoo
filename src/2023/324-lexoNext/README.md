# lexoNext

Interview question of the [issue #324 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/if-you-spend-too-much-time-looking-in-the/).

## The Question

**Given a number, rearrange its digits to make it the next larger number.** So not the maximum size it can be, but the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers!

Example:

```js
> lexoNext(123)
> 132

> lexoNext(314159)
> 314195
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
