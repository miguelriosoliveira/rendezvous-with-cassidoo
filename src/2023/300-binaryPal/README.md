# binaryPal

Interview question of the [issue #300 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/1545/).

## The Question

**Write a function to find out whether the binary representation of a number is palindrome or not.**

Example:

```js
> binaryPal(5)
> true

> binaryPal(10)
> false
```

## Installing & Running

Just `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn test` to run the tests!
