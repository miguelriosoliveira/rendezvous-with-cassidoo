# starAngles

Interview question of the [issue #295 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/5341/).

## The Question

**Write a function where given integer `n`, it returns the angles at each point of a star with n points.** Hint: The sum of the angles at each point of a 5 pointed star is 180 degrees, and at a 6 pointed is 360 degrees.

## Installing & Running

Just `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn test` to run the tests!
