# printDigits

Interview question of the [issue #287 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/if-you-dont-live-your-life-then-who-will-rihanna/).

## The Question

**Print the digits 0 through 100 without using the characters `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, or `9` in your code. Get creative!**

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
