# returnGift

Interview question of the [issue #332 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/in-seed-time-learn-in-harvest-teach-in-winter/).

## The Question

**You have some gifts you want to return. Gifts bought in December have a 90-day return window, and all other gifts have a 30-day return window. Given a gift's buy date, write a function that prints the last day you can return the gift.** You can choose how dates should be formatted!

Example:

```js
> returnGift('Dec 25, 2023')
> "Mar 23, 2024"
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
