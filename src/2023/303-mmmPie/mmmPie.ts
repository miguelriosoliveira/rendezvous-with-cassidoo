/*
Given an array of people objects (where each person has a name and a number of pie pieces theyâ€™re hungry for)
and a number for the number of pieces that the pie can be cut into, return the number of pies you need to buy.

Example:

> arr = [{ name: Joe, num: 9 }, { name: Cami, num: 3 }, { name: Cassidy, num: 4 }]
> mmmPie(arr, 8)
> 2 // 16 pieces needed, pies can be cut into 8 pieces, so 2 pies should be bought
*/

interface People {
	name: string;
	num: number;
}

export function mmmPie(people: People[], availableSlices: number): number {
	const numSlicesWanted = people.reduce((slicesWanted, person) => slicesWanted + person.num, 0);
	return Math.ceil(numSlicesWanted / availableSlices);
}
