# kPal

Interview question of the [issue #323 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/beware-of-missing-chances-otherwise-it-may-be/).

## The Question

**Given a string `s`, you are allowed to delete at most `k` characters. Find if the string can be a palindrome after deleting at most `k` characters.**

Example:

```js
> kPal('abcweca', 2)
> true

> kPal('acxcb', 1)
> false
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
