# spinTheWheel

Interview question of the [issue #283 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/the-man-who-moves-a-mountain-begins-by-carrying/).

## The Question

**Implement a “spin the wheel” game where the player can bet on each spin of a wheel and either double their money, lose their money, or keep their money.**
You can choose how the user bets, and what data structures you might want to use for the player and their money!

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
