# maxPointsOnLine

Interview question of the [issue #296 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/9753/).

## The Question

**Given n points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.**

Example:
```js
> maxPointsOnLine([[1,1], [3,2], [5,3], [4,1], [2,3], [1,4]])
> 4
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
