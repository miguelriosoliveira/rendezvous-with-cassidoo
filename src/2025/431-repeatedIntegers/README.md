# repeatedIntegers

Interview question of the [issue #431 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/words-once-they-are-printed-have-a-life-of-their/).

## The Question

**Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns an array containing all integers from `1` to `n`, where each integer `i` appears exactly `i` times in the result. For example, `3` should appear 3 times, `5` should appear 5 times, and so on.** The order of the integers in the output array does not matter.

Example:

```js
> repeatedIntegers(4)
> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
