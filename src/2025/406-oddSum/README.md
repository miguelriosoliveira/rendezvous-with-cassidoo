# oddSum

Interview question of the [issue #406 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/false-expectations-take-away-joy-sandra-bullock/).

## The Question

**Given two arrays, return all pairs (where each number is in each array) whose sum is an odd number.**

Examples:

```js
oddSum([9, 14, 6, 2, 11], [8, 4, 7, 20])
> [9, 20], [14, 7], [11,8]

oddSum([2, 4, 6, 8], [10, 12, 14])
> null // (or whatever falsy value you prefer)
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
