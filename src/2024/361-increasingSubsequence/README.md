# increasingSubsequence

Interview question of the [issue #361 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/creativity-takes-courage-henri-matisse/).

## The Question

**Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.**

Example:

```js
> increasingSubsequence([10, 9, 2, 3, 7, 101, 18])
> 4

> increasingSubsequence([4, 4, 4, 4, 3])
> 1
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
