# maxGap

Interview question of the [issue #343 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/if-you-dont-go-towards-the-thing-you-fear-you/).

## The Question

**Given an integer array `arr`, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in `arr`'s sorted form.** Return 0 if there's 0 or 1 elements.

Example:

```js
> maxGap([3,6,9,1,2])
> 3
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
