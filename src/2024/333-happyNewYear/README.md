## The Question

**Write a program that prints `Happy new year!` without using the [string/character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_literal) literals for the characters in the string!**

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
