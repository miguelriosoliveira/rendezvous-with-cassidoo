# moveNums

Interview question of the [issue #443 of rendezvous with cassidoo](https://buttondown.com/cassidoo/archive/everyone-deserves-the-space-to-change-and-for/).

## The Question

**Given an integer array and a number `n`, move all of the `n`s to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-`n`s.** Bonus: do this without making a copy of the array!

Examples:

```js
$ moveNums([0,2,0,3,10], 0)
$ [2,3,10,0,0]
```

## Installing & Running

Just `pnpm i` to install all dependencies and then `pnpm t` to run the tests!
